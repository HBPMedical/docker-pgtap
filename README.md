pgTAP - Unit testing for PostgreSQL.

This is a docker image that contains pgTAP.

## About pgTAP

> pgTAP is a suite of database functions that make it easy to write TAP-emitting unit tests in psql scripts or xUnit-style test functions. The TAP output is suitable for harvesting, analysis, and reporting by a TAP harness.
